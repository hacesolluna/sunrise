  <h1>Testimony</h1>
  <h4>"My partner Serena and I learned how pitches work. LIke what to include in 90 second pitch or 150 second one. We really appreciated the speaking sessions which taught us a lot about market research, IP, etc. Another remarkable thing was that it helped improve your speaking and presenting skills a lot. "</h4>

  <h4>"The hardest thing for us was to figure out the pain point of our customers in the beginning. We want our products to really help people. After doing some research, we finally found some intriguing points. Personally, my favorite part of the program was mentorship. This gave us the stage to talk with many entrepreneurs and get their valuable feedback. Of course, the final pitch summit was also a highlight which gave us a very special experience."</h4>

  <h4>"Public speaking is not my strongest trait, but preparing for this competition improved my speaking, a lot. This Sunrise Venture competition was my very first entrepreneurial experience. As a person, I feel more confident speaking more confidently. As an entrepreneur, I know how to attract people to my ideas better. My favorite part of the sunrise venture program was being at the final pitch summit. It was a great experience! I got to talk to other contestants and get to know them and their ideas. I also got to meet the judges in person."</h4>

Serena:
The hardest thing for us was to figure out the pain point of our customers in the beginning. We want our products to really help people. After doing some research, we finally found some intriguing points. 

Personally, my favorite part of the program was mentorship. This gave us the stage to talk with many entrepreneurs and get their valuable feedback. Of course, the final pitch summit was also a highlight which gave us a very special experience. 

Warren: Public speaking is not my strongest trait, but preparing for this competition improved my speaking, a lot. This Sunrise Venture competition was my very first entrepreneurial experience.

As a person, I feel more confident speaking more confidently. As an entrepreneur, I know how to attract people to my ideas better. 

My favorite part of the sunrise venture program was being at the final pitch summit. It was a great experience! I got to talk to other contestants and get to know them and their ideas. I also got to meet the judges in person.
